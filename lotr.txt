It is said that the Great Adversary rebelled against the first Pantokrator and set to take the world for himself, and to change and corrupt all that was made to his own will. Elves he captured and subjected to terrible tortures and sorceries, and from them twisted the race of Orcs. After the fall of the first Dark Lord, Orcs became the chief soldiers of Angband, as many of the other powers had fled or vanished. Orcs are the slaves of Angband, miserable creatures who are all too eager to inflict suffering and destruction on others. Orc archers are the least in the slave's hierarchy, but a useful tool for the armies of Angband."

Trolls are fiercely strong, but dull and slow-witted. In lands of Chaos they will grow in might, while lands of Order they return to stone from whence they came, and are useless in battle. Some of the greater trolls are selected to be used as guards for important leaders and commanders. They are encouraged to acts of even greater ferocity in defence of their master."

#descr "The Istar of Crafts was sent by the Pantokrator to scour the lands for the remaining servants of the Great Adversary and destroy them. For a time, he served faithfully, hunting down dark enemies and earning glory and fame in the name of the Pantokrator. Over time, his pride grew with his fame, and he began to desire more power for himself. Now that the Pantokrator has vanished, he will seize his opportunity to become God over all. The Istar of Crafts is powerful with his words, being a mighty commander whose forces would rather die than disappoint. His craft with words is so heinous, that even opposing forces may be convinced to abandon their posts to flock to his side."

#descr "Once the first and greatest of the Pantokrator’s servants, he became enamoured with the World and lusted after it for himself. He rebelled against the Pantokrator and fought his peers for dominion of the World. After an eons long war he was defeated, and he and his servants fled. But they were not destroyed. They snuck back into the world and created Utumno and the fortress of Angband. He attacked the servants of the Pantokrator again, and caused much damage before being overthrown. Utumno was all but destroyed and the walls of Angband broken, and he was cast into prison for his crimes. But now the Pantokrator has vanished, his servants have scattered. And the Fallen Valar will rise again to take what is due."

#name "Dwarf Forge-Priest"
#descr "The art of smithying is considered a holy work among the dwarves. the works of their hands are their worship, and far more practical than hours spent on bended knee. The Forge-Priest is a Dwarf who has come far in the skill of crafting, and has divined many secrets in the forging of magic items and equipment. While Dwarves have a great love for the works of the hand, they are a jealous and secretive race, and rarely work well with others. Thus, they make for poor researchers."

#descr "At first glance, there might be little difference between the Forge Lord and the Rune Smith. But where the Rune Smith focuses all his attention and energy on perfecting his craft and forging mighty and legendary works, the Forge Lord has opened his heart more to his people. While Dwarves engage in trade rather than gift-giving, he nevertheless makes his skills more open and available, and hoards his secrets less jealously than his peers. Thus, Forge Lords are held in high esteem by the Khazad, and it is because of their ceaseless labour that the Dwarven armies are maintained as best-equipped soldiers in the world."

Sometimes a Dwarf is born who is so alike these ancient legends, with memories and knowledge long lost, that it is agreed he must be one of the Seven Fathers reborn to walk among the Dwarves again. Reborn Fathers are held in awe by other Dwarves, and they excel at any skill they put their hands to. They are living legends among the Khazad, and even the Kings listen closely to their counsel."

He wields a sword stolen from his father made from the metal of a fallen star, said to slay anyone who is wounded by it. His only fault is his desire for Princess Idril, who is his cousin. She is the only one aware of this, and she loathes him for it. Since she has married Tuor, Maeglin has fallen deeper into himself, gnawing on his hatred of Tuor, seeing him as his greatest rival."

Here he has dwelt for many centuries, leaving rarely and letting few of his people ever leave the gleaming walls of his city. In this way he has kept an island of peace amidst the turmoils of war around him. He is a great king, powerful and kind, though he is proud and is difficult to sway once he has made a decision. Nevertheless, he is loved by all his people. It was with some reluctance that he opened the gates of Gondolin and led his people forth, but the fulfilling of the Prophecy and the rise of the Awakening God were enough to push his doubts aside and now he leads his people to claim the world for the Awakening God."
