It is said that the Great Adversary rebelled against the first Pantokrator and set to take the world for himself, and to change and corrupt all that was made to his own will. Elves he captured and subjected to terrible tortures and sorceries, and from them twisted the race of Orcs. After the fall of the first Dark Lord, Orcs became the chief soldiers of Angband, as many of the other powers had fled or vanished. Orcs are the slaves of Angband, miserable creatures who are all too eager to inflict suffering and destruction on others. Orc archers are the least in the slave's hierarchy, but a useful tool for the armies of Angband."

Trolls are fiercely strong, but dull and slow-witted. In lands of Chaos they will grow in might, while lands of Order they return to stone from whence they came, and are useless in battle. Some of the greater trolls are selected to be used as guards for important leaders and commanders. They are encouraged to acts of even greater ferocity in defence of their master."

Uninterested in matters of state or other Dwarves, they have confined themselves to unlocking the secrets of smith-craft.

#name "Forge Lord"
#descr "At first glance, there might be little difference between the Forge Lord and the Rune Smith. But where the Rune Smith focuses all his attention and energy on perfecting his craft and forging mighty and legendary works, the Forge Lord has opened his heart more to his people. While Dwarves engage in trade rather than gift-giving, he nevertheless makes his skills more open and available, and hoards his secrets less jealously than his peers. Thus, Forge Lords are held in high esteem by the Khazad, and it is because of their ceaseless labour that the Dwarven armies are maintained as best-equipped soldiers in the world."

#descr "It is held in Dwarf-Lore that their race came of seven Fathers, the first to be created by an ancient deity. They were given peoples and told to go out into the world and make use of the gifts they had been given. Sometimes a Dwarf is born who is so alike these ancient legends, with memories and knowledge long lost, that it is agreed he must be one of the Seven Fathers reborn to walk among the Dwarves again. Reborn Fathers are held in awe by other Dwarves, and they excel at any skill they put their hands to. They are living legends among the Khazad, and even the Kings listen closely to their counsel."

But the Adversary was defeated, his minions scattered, and he was bound and thrown into the void. But Angband was not wholly destroyed, and so Gorthaur the Cruel, chief lieutenant of the Great Adversary returned and created a nation of Darkness in his master’s image. Still they were but a shadow of their former power, until the coming of the Awakening God. now the forges in Angband ring once more, and long-forgotten servants are gathering again under Angband’s banner. The drums of war are sounding, and this time Angband will stop at nothing to cover the world in Darkness."

Military: Orc and Human infantry. Werewolf scouts and shock troops. Troll heavy infantry, Orcs and Trolls stronger in turmoil.
Magic: Any, mostly Fire and Death, some blood.
Priests: Weak.
Buildings: Primitive. Starts with a powerful citadel."
