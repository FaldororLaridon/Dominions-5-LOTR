After the fall of the first Dark Lord, Orcs became the chief soldiers of Angband, as many of the other powers had fled or vanished. Orcs are the slaves of Angband, miserable creatures who are all too eager to inflict suffering and destruction on others. Orc archers are the least in the slave's hierarchy, but a useful tool for the armies of Angband."

Some of the greater trolls are selected to be used as guards for important leaders and commanders. They are encouraged to acts of even greater ferocity in defence of their master."

When the great War defeated them and his Lord was taken and bound, Gorthaur fled and hid himself from the Pantokrator and his servants. When they had left, he snuck back into Angband and began re-establishing its power, gathering together its servants and raiding nearby nations. Now that the awakened God has claimed dominion over Angband, Gorthaur has pledged his allegiance to his new Master, and will lead Angband to victory under the Iron Crown. Gorthaur is a skilled manipulator and commander, and has access to great power himself. He is a shapeshifter and can take many forms to suit his needs."

#name "Balrog Soldier"
#descr "The Valaraukar, Balrogs, were the greatest of the servants of the first Dark Lord, and fought at his side against the Pantokrator. When he was defeated, they fled or hid in deep caverns beneath Angband and the ruins of Utumno. Now that a new god is awakening, they begin to gather once more to Angband, ready to lead the armies of Angband against the world."

#newmonster 3539
#name "Iron Serpent"
#descr "Great war machines made in the pits of Angband, Iron Serpents have a singular function; knocking down enemy walls. They are slow and cumbersome, and are of little use otherwise in combat, though they can trample their enemies into the dirt as they make their way inevitably towards enemy fortifications."

#name "Angband"
#epithet "Reign of the Iron Crown"
#era 1
#descr "Angband is all that is left of an ancient evil. Once only a fortress in the hands of the Great Adversary, it was created as a defence in the war against the First Pantokrator. But the Adversary was defeated, his minions scattered, and he was bound and thrown into the void. But Angband was not wholly destroyed, and so Gorthaur the Cruel, chief lieutenant of the Great Adversary returned and created a nation of Darkness in his master’s image. Still they were but a shadow of their former power, until the coming of the Awakening God. now the forges in Angband ring once more, and long-forgotten servants are gathering again under Angband’s banner. The drums of war are sounding, and this time Angband will stop at nothing to cover the world in Darkness."
#summary "Race: various. Orcs, Men, Vampires, Werewolves and Trolls. Prefers cold scale +1
Military: Orc and Human infantry. Werewolf scouts and shock troops. Troll heavy infantry, Orcs and Trolls stronger in turmoil.
Magic: Any, mostly Fire and Death, some blood.
Priests: Weak. Dominion spreads turmoil slowly.
Buildings: Primitive. Starts with a powerful citadel."
#brief "A nation of dark and evil creatures bent on destruction. They are led by powerful Demons and Spirits who spur them on with fear rather than leadership."
