The origins of the Orc lie deep in the mists of time. It is said that the greatest servant of the First Pantokrator rebelled against his master and set to take the world for himself, and to change and corrupt all that was made to his own will. Elves he captured and subjected to terrible tortures and sorceries, and from them twisted the race of Orcs.


After the fall of the first Dark Lord, Orcs became the chief soldiers of Angband, as many of the other powers had fled or vanished. Great armies armed with steel, heavy helms and scimitars issued forth to lay waste to the enemies of Angband. Though the Orc is no longer the chief soldier of Angband, many still remain who remember those days and retain their weapons and arms to fight again for the glory of the Iron Crown."

#name "Easterling Shaman"
#descr "When the Darkness came about Men, many of them succumbed to fear. But there were many of strong will among them who resisted or broke away. Where force would not cow, coercion would. Servants were dispatched and taught some of the men powers they had not before discovered. They became shamans of the Easterlings and allied with the dark powers in search of more power."

#name "Balrog Captain"
#descr "The Valaraukar, Balrogs, were the greatest of the servants of the first Dark Lord, and fought at his side against the Pantokrator. When he was defeated, they fled or hid in deep caverns beneath Angband and the ruins of Utumno. Now that a new god is awakening, they begin to gather once more to Angband, ready to lead the armies of Angband against the world."

#name "Fallen Spirit"
#descr "Many spirits lesser and greater were seduced by the first Dark Lord. They came in great variety with different magic powers and fought at his side against the Pantokrator. These spirits retain their different powers, but have adopted a uniform appearance, an echo of their ancient Master. It is their symbol and their pride, as in the years before the Awakening God, they became lords of their own little kingdoms."
