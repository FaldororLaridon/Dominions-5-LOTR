She is the only one aware of this, and she loathes him for it. Since she has married Tuor, Maeglin has fallen deeper into himself, gnawing on his hatred of Tuor, seeing him as his greatest rival."

He instructed a very specific set of arms and armour be made for him, that Turgon would know him when he was seen. Tuor is the son of one of the great heroes of Men, and it was he who answered the call and brought the tidings of the Awakening God to Gondolin. He has risen swiftly in the ranks of Gondolin, and leads his own house. He married Princess Idril, and is considered Sacred by the people of Gondolin."

Here he has dwelt for many centuries, leaving rarely and letting few of his people ever leave the gleaming walls of his city. In this way he has kept an island of peace amidst the turmoils of war around him. He is a great king, powerful and kind, though he is proud and is difficult to sway once he has made a decision. Nevertheless, he is loved by all his people. It was with some reluctance that he opened the gates of Gondolin and led his people forth, but the fulfilling of the Prophecy and the rise of the Awakening God were enough to push his doubts aside and now he leads his people to claim the world for the Awakening God."
