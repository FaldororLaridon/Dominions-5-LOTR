#name "Soldier of the Tree"
#descr "The most numerous of the Houses of Gondolin is the House of the Tree. They are not the wealthiest, nor most prestigious of the the houses, and make up much of what would be called 'the common folk' in a different land. The soldiers of the Tree are less well-armed and trained than most of the Gondothlim, but they are still Noldor, and thus a force to be reckoned with. They wield heavy iron-studded clubs into battle. As with all the Gondothlim, they can traverse through mountains with ease."

#name "Soldier of the Mole"
#descr "The folk of the Mole consist mostly of miners that delve deep into the mountains around Gondolin, and the soldiers that guard them or keep a watchful eye out for enemies. They are grimmer than most of the Noldor, and do not inspire the same awe in lesser beings as most of their kind. Their Lord Maeglin has equipped them with Galvorn armour, a secret passed down from his father that he now shares only with is own folk.
