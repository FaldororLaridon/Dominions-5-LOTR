#name "Orc-Hunter"
#descr "Since the days when Thu first sent invasions of Orcs out from the fortress of Angband, Orcs have been one of the greatest threats to Doriath. Through the forests, silent and deadly, the Orc-Hunters mercilessly hunt down their quarry, knowing that any who survive their attacks might make it home to report to their commanders. The Orc-hunters carry the blessing of Queen Melian, and strike awe into their foes in battle. tehy are more lightly armoured than the protectors to allow for quicker and quieter speed, relying on their shields and awe to defend them."

#descr "Doriath sits at the foot of of the Mountains of Shadow, where the children of Ungoliant scuttle and weave their maddening webs. Even the servants of Morgoth do not dare to travel there, but such a taint so close to their borders cannot be ignored. the spiders are best kept at a distance, and so Sindar of keen eye and heavy hand are armed with longbows and sent periodically to help drive the spiders back from the borders of Doriath."
