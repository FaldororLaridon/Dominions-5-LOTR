#name "Blue Mountain Sapper"
#descr "No race is more attuned to the working of minerals and the deeps of the earth than the Dwarves. They are a hardy folk, difficult to daunt or slay, and masters of forging like few others can claim. The Sappers of the twin cities are often former miners that have answered the call to war and joined the Dwarven hosts. Their years in deep places have given them great nightvision and a knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of stone. No wall can stand for long if the Sappers turn their will towards it."

#name "Khazad Archer"
#descr "The infantry of the twin cities of Nogrod and Belegost are among the finest in the world. But the Dwarves recognised the nessecity of range against faster enemies, or in defence of their cities. Therefore, they developed a type of bow designed with their short but sturdy bodies in mind. the steelbow fires surprisingly far with little effort on the part of the archer. Enchantments are wrought into the very metal, to defy the shields of their enemies. Ware to those who mock the Dwarves!

#name "Khazad Spearman" 
#descr "The Khazad, or Dwarves as other folk name them, boast some of the finest infantry in the world. Their soldiers are skilled, hardy, and difficult to daunt or sway by magic. They bear armour of cunning rings and helms etched with terrible designs that strike fear into the enemies that look upon them. Their armour makes them almost entirely immune to fire, and many an Abysian assault has broken on the rock that is a Khazad shield-wall.

They are trained to fight and slay the elites of other nations, Wielding their great battle-axes to deadly efficiancy. The last thing many would-be invaders of the halls of the Dwarves have seen is the Wyrmslayers in gilded armour charging towards them, and the last thing they hear is their battle-cry. "Baruk Khazad! Khazad ai Menu!"
