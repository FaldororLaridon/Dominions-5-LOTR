#descr "No race is more attuned to the working of minerals and the deeps of the earth than the Dwarves. They are a hardy folk, difficult to daunt or slay, and masters of forging like few others can claim. The Sappers of the twin cities are often former miners that have answered the call to war and joined the Dwarven hosts. Their years in deep places have given them great nightvision and a knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of stone. No wall can stand for long if the Sappers turn their will towards it."

#descr "The infantry of the twin cities of Nogrod and Belegost are among the finest in the world. But the Dwarves recognised the necessity of range against faster enemies, or in defence of their cities. Therefore, they developed a type of bow designed with their short but sturdy bodies in mind. The steelbow fires surprisingly far with little effort on the part of the archer. Enchantments are wrought into the very metal, to defy the shields of their enemies. Ware to those who mock the Dwarves!"

While Dwarves have a great love for the works of the hand, they are a jealous and secretive race, and rarely work well with others. Thus, they make for poor researchers."

#descr "At first glance, there might be little difference between the Forge Lord and the Rune Smith. But where the Rune Smith focuses all his attention and energy on perfecting his craft and forging mighty and legendary works, the Forge Lord has opened his heart more to his people. While Dwarves engage in trade rather than gift-giving, he nevertheless makes his skills more open and available, and hoards his secrets less jealously than his peers. Thus, Forge Lords are held in high esteem by the Khazad, and it is because of their ceaseless labour that the Dwarven armies are maintained as best-equipped soldiers in the world."

#descr "It is held in Dwarf-Lore that their race came of seven Fathers, the first to be created by an ancient deity. They were given peoples and told to go out into the world and make use of the gifts they had been given. Sometimes a Dwarf is born who is so alike these ancient legends, with memories and knowledge long lost, that it is agreed he must be one of the Seven Fathers reborn to walk among the Dwarves again. Reborn Fathers are held in awe by other Dwarves, and they excel at any skill they put their hands to. They are living legends among the Khazad, and even the Kings listen closely to their counsel."
