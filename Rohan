Weapons: Spear, lance, broadsowrd, shortbow, composite bow?
armor: chain curiass and hauberk, maybe scale for lower tier units and leather for militia?
2 militia units, one mounted, one not.
Darkvision 25 to test

3 unmounted units, militia, unmoiunted rider, Meduseld Guard

militia rider, 2 light cav (one w/ light lance, one w/short bow) 2 Riders (1 w/ heavy oneshotlance/sword, 1 w/composite bow and broad sword. Riderw/lance has berserk?
no, both Riders should have it. Shieldmaiden, more lightly armoured, more focused on speed, perhaps slightly better morale and magic resistance? Possibly an elite Rider as well
but I'm not sure that's nessecary. Sons of Eorl will be accessible through a level 3/4 nature conjuration spell where the Mearas are called and mounted by elite warriors. This will
be Rohans sole sacred unit, which will leave them much more open to focus more heavily on their dominion which may well be nessecary with their setup. 

Leaders: scout, Captain, (120 leadership) Marshal (one step higher, maybe with priest level?) Minstril level 2 priest, 2 failed apprentices (one weak, one strong, earth and
fire magic, some astral) and the Old Wives (nature and some water, a weaker and stronger version, stronger version may also have a level of priest.)
